- Algorithm to be used: ```BFS, DFS or UCS```
- Name of the source node
- Names of the destination nodes
- Names of the middle nodes
- Number of edges (pipes)
- Graph (Edges)
- Start time

Output
------
- For each case, report the name of destination node where water reached first, and also the time that it reached that node.
- If no path was found, print "None"
- Generates ```output.txt```
